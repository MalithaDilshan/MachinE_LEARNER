Developing the Machine Learning algorithms using Python

Machine learning is the basic basic part of the AI technology. A deep undestanding of the machine learning concepts and its basic algorithm is helpful to undestand the advanced learning models in AI field. Simply, ML algorithms or learning methods can be devided into following 3 catogoris,
1. Superviced Learning 
      The basic idea of the superviced learning is 'learning from the past experiences'. Therefore, it should be used a trained 
      model using past and present data to predic future data. Basically, 'Classification', 'Regression' and 'Forecasting'
      algorithms are belong to this catogory.
2. Unsuperviced Learning 
      Here, these algorithms use the existing data to find the relationships between variables. And also, this method is not using
      past experience to learn patterns. basically 'Clustering' and 'Associations' methods are belongs to this type.
3. Reinforcement Learning
      

*Superviced Learning*
1. Linear Regression Model:
   use the 'gradient_decent_quandl_application' and 'implement_linear_regression_model' folders for accessing codes. There are .pdf 
   files for more infomations with the analysis of measurements.
